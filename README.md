# Soundfont3

SoundFont3 is a parser written in TypeScript for Node.js and (modern) web browsers. 

The original parser complies with [SoundFont 2.01 specification](http://www.synthfont.com/SFSPEC21.PDF), with the goal of achieving compliance with [SoundFont 2.04 specification](http://www.synthfont.com/sfspec24.pdf).

[SoundFont3](https://github.com/musescore/sftools) was created by [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/en) to compress SoundFont2 with OGG VORBIS.

This library is not production ready, hence the version 0.x.x. Some SoundFonts may be parsed incorrectly and the API may have breaking changes in the future. The first production release 1.0.0 and beyond will follow semantic versioning.

## Installation

The library can be installed with `yarn`, `npm` or using a `<script>` tag.

```bash
$ yarn add soundfont2
```

For full installation instructions, please refer to [the documentation](https://musidi-org.github.io/soundfont3/getting-started/installation.html).
