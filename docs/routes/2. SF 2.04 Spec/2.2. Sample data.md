# Sample data
::: tip Prerequisite
This section requires a [basic understanding of SoundFont 2.04](/routes/2.%20SF%202.04%20Spec/README.html) and binary.
:::

SoundFont sample data is accessible through `SoundFont3.sampleData`.
* Samples are WAV files in linear [PCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation) format.
* Each sample is padded with at least 46 bytes in between.
* Sample must loop so end point value matches start point value.

## `smpl` - 16-bit WAV
Accessible through `SoundFont3.sampleData`

WAV file in 16 bit signed little endian (least significant byte first).

```C
int16_t[] soundFontVersionMajor = ... // Multiple 2 byte
char zeroPadding = 0 // >= 46 byte
// Even number of byte total
```

## `sm24` - Plus 8-bit WAV
If 24-bit WAV is provided. The additional 8 bit detail is stored in this chunk. Chunk size should be 1/2 of `smpl`

```C
int8_t[] soundFontVersionMajor = ...
char zeroPadding = 0 // >= 46 byte
// Even number of byte total
```
