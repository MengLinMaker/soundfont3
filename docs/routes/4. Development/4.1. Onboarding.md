# Onboarding

The library uses `Node.js`, `TypeScript` and `Webpack` for development, `Jest` to run unit tests, `ESLint` for linting the source code and `Prettier` for the code style.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/musidi-org/soundfont3.git
```

2. Install the dependencies.

```bash
$ npm ci
```

3. Build the files.

```bash
$ npm run build
```

## Running Unit Tests

The library uses `Jest` for unit tests. This is done automatically before committing, to prevent any bugs, but you can also run `Jest` manually.

```bash
$ npm run test
```

## Linting

Files are linted with `ESLint`. This is done automatically before committing, to ensure a consistent code base, but you can also run `ESLint` manually.

```bash
$ npm run lint
```

## Code Style

The library uses `Prettier` to ensure a consistent code style. The `Prettier` settings can be found in [this file](https://github.com/Mrtenz/SoundFont3/blob/master/.prettierrc). It is automatically run before committing, but you can also run `Prettier` manually.

```bash
$ npm run prettier
```
