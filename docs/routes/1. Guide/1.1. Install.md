# Install

## Use package manager (Recommended)

This method is recommended for Node.js and web browsers. You can install the library using `npm`, `pnpm` or `yarn` by running one of the following commands.

```bash
$ npm install SoundFont3
```

```bash
$ pnpm install SoundFont3
```

```bash
$ yarn add SoundFont3
```


Then include the library in your project, simply by importing it. If you want to use the library in a web browser, you can use a module bundler like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/),  [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) or [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Import ES6

```typescript
import { SoundFont3 } from 'SoundFont3'
```

## Import CommonJS

```typescript
const { SoundFont3 } = require('SoundFont3')
```
